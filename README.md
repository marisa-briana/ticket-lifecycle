After the tickets have been submitted, you will see them on the screen after you log into OsTicket as an Agent or Admin. the tickets can be assigned to an IT professional. In order for the ticket to be handled properly, information regarding the level of severity can be changed. For this ticket, the Priority was changed to “Emergency,” the SLA Plan was changed to “SEV-A,” and the Department was changed to “System Administrators.” The ticket was also assigned to “Jane Doe,” who is an administrator in this scenario.

Now that the ticket has been assigned to the appropriate department and people, the IT staff can work on finding a solution to the issue. Each time a change is made to the ticket or there is an update to the situation, a comment can be made in the Ticket Thread. This allows everyone viewing the ticket to be aware of what has already happened and facilitates communication between everyone involved.

<p>
Once the issue has been resolved, the ticket can be closed. In the osTicket system, the ticket will move from the Open section to the Closed section in this stage. For IT professionals, it is important to know where to find closed tickets since they can be browsed and used to find solutions to open tickets.
